\section{Conclusions}

\textrm{Dusk} Network is an unrestricted, unsurveilled and fully distributed cryptosystem designed for high-rate voice and data communications, enforcing the utmost level of privacy to the partaking peers. The network features a novel blockchain-based digital cash called \textrm{Dusk}, used to directly incentivize participation in the network and promote widespread adoption. \textrm{Dusk} features untraceability through the use of ring confidential transactions, unlinkability through the use of stealth address and protection from Sybil attack and double spending through a novel consensus algorithm called Segregated Byzantine Agreement or SBA$\large\star$. SBA$\large\star$ provides direct block finality by preventing forking while providing virtually unbounded scalability. The network is built on top of an efficient gossip network which utilizes non-repliable datagram and garlic routing in order to prevent IP Address propagation. Finally, the \textrm{Dusk} Network is complemented with an off- online file transfer mechanism and with realtime \textrm{Dusk} payment channel to enable undetectable and fast peer-to-peer data communication through a technique we call Secure Tunnel Switching.
