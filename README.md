# X2X Network Technology Whitepaper

## Abstract

In order to satisfy a broad set of data transfer scenario, the X2X network adds to the IP protocol suite (used mostly in a peer-to-peer fashion) an additional layer of security brought by the adoption of a mix of established strategies and novel techniques with the aim to protect the privacy of the communicating peers from any observer and each other while satisfying a variety of challenging use cases varying from fast communication (e.g. voice calls) to large data transfer (e.g. file transmission).

X2X circumvents the notorious unreliability of crowd-sourced infrastructures by embedding economic incentives into the core mechanism of the network itself. Such incentives are designed to encourage peers to partake in the network in a permission-less, anonymous and private fashion.

## Paper Outline

The research paper outlines three different parts that constitute the pillars of the X2X Network:

1. The X2X Blockchain relying on Segregated Byzantine Agreement consensus algorithm
2. The X2X Anonymous Network Layer describing the communication layer for the whole network
3. The Secure Tunnel Switching as a protocol for cryptocurrency-related payments of time-unbound transmission (streaming)
4. The protocol for secure file transfers

The sections are preceded by a description of the cryptographic primitives used throughout the paper and outlined in the [Cryptonote paper](https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf), [BAâ˜…](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01341) and other resources.
